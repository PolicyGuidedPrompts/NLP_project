Benchmarking

Maybe try Experience Replay

Currently our Agent doesn't keep track of the original question.
We might want an agent that keep the original question and only add the new information to it.

How good is the algorithm compared to simply adding questions+answers by random (I.e check against context learning with no training)

Split train test

Hyperparameter tuning

Different policy search algorithms (Maybe add DQN/TRPO)

Continuous action space

Make sure Agent doesn't choose questions that simply returns True all the time when the gold answer is true

Make sure actions doesn't repeat in same episode

Add retrievers to the pipeline

Add description and not only the question to the prompt

Think about adding 4 last prompts as part of the state

Missing our epsilon greedy method

Add wandb

Make configuration YAML file

Install script for the entire github project

Create Readme

If time permits, read advanced options:
