When prompt too long, must choose special action

caching dir of torch and HuggingFace

discount factor for punishing the agent for taking too long

do not repeat the same action

Maybe try Experience Replay

Currently out Agent doesn't keep track of the original question.
We might want an agent that keep the original question and only add the new information to it.

Batching when training the agent (the PolicyNet)

Make the code way faster

How good is the algorithm compared to simply adding questions+answers by random (I.e check against context learning with no training)

Different datasets + tasks

Different rewards models

Different models for the agent

Different encoder models

Different LLM models

Split train test

Hyperparameter tuning

Different policy search algorithms (e.g. REINFORCE, Vanilla Policy Gradient + BaseLine, PPO, DQN, A2C, etc.)

Continuous action space

Make sure Agent doesn't choose questions that simply returns True all the time when the gold answer is true

Make sure actions doesn't repeat in same episode

Configuration file, make it easy to change from outside

Code to change dynamically if cuda available or not

Add retrievers to the pipeline
